Hue-asymmetry stereoscopic image database
 Hue-asymmetry Stereoscopic 3D image database for visual comfort Evaluation

 For the evaluation experiment, we created a 3D image database with 9 different levels of hue asymmetry along with 6 stereoscopic images as references. The references consist of two types of images with a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels. One type is 3 natural images captured using a 3D digital camera (Fujifilm FinePix 3D W3, Capturing details: ISO AUTO, Image Resolution: 1920*1080, Aperture Value: f/8, Maximum aperture: 3.8, Exposure Control: ADV 3D, Exposure Time:1/80s; Focus: 6mm), the other type is 3 computer-generated images selected from the NVIDIA 3D gallery. We named it Imgxx_Natural_Hue_xx.jpg and Imgxx_Computer-generated_Hue_xx.jpg in the “Stimuli” folder. The hue-asymmetry image has a resolution of 3840×1080 pixels. Therefore, there is a total number of 61 stereoscopic images in the stimulus folder, including 54 hue-asymmetry images, 6 reference images and 1 gray image.
